## Removal of the DangoPlayer Uni migration code that allowed migrating from the obsolete DangoPlayer and DangoPlayer TV apps to the modern DangoPlayer app 
The migration code that allowed migrating IPTV Lists from the obsolete DangoPlayer and DangoPlayer TV apps to the modern DangoPlayer app has been completely removed

### Here is how the migration code worked on versions 5.0freya and earlier:

### And here is what happens if you attempt to use the migration code starting with version 6.0usagi:

</video>

Also, now, deleting IPTV Lists is much more easier

And if you are on Android TV or Google TV, you can go to the "Manage Lists" section, choose the IPTV List you want to manage and choose if you want to edit or delete the chosen IPTV List

## Backported to Android 8.1 Oreo and earlier versions of Android down to Android 5.0 Lollipop 
Also, DangoPlayer versi√≥n 6.0usagi has been fully backported to Android 8.1 Oreo and earlier versions down to Android 5.0 Lollipop, so now users of these Android versions can now use the modern DangoPlayer app

### Here is the screenshots of DangoPlayer 6.0usagi running on Android 8.1 Oreo:
