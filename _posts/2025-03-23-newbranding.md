After a long time, we want to announce that DangoPlayer's branding will be completely renewed. 

To start with, the new colors that will accompany the new DangoPlayer branding are Pink, Mint Green, Yellow and Purple, In addition, the visibility of the word DangoPlayer in Japanese (だんごプレイヤー) in the logo has been improved.

This branding change will now be reflected on this website, as well as on the DangoPlayer GitHub repository, and will soon be reflected in the DangoPlayer application for Android, Android TV and Google TV in the next version (6.0usagi), which is in development

We hope you like this DangoPlayer rebranding.
