# Future plans for DangoPlayer
Here are the future plans for DangoPlayer, which can include new features and changes

We are developing the next version of DangoPlayer (**6.0usagi**), which would include various changes and enhancements, as well as new features and a UI overhaul

## Implemented but not tested features and changes for the next version of DangoPlayer (6.0usagi)
- Branding overhaul, by using a completely new color set
- Full UI Overhaul, by removing support for Dynamic Colors on Android 12 and later in favor of DangoPlayer's new branding colors, and by applying different colors for the sections
- Optimization of the code by removing unused and obsolete features and resources from the code
- Removal of the manual screen rotation button and their functionality from the player on mobile devices, to make the app fully Android 16 compliant, however, screen rotation would continue to work by enabling Auto-Rotate in the system from Quick Settings
- Unification of the internal DangoPlayer libraries (Android TV Input Framework integration, List processing, List parsing, etc.) under the new UsagiCore branding
- Complete removal of the DangoPlayer Uni migration code that allowed IPTV lists migration from the obsolete DangoPlayer and DangoPlayer TV apps (formerly known as **VideoTime** and **TubiLeap**) to the modern DangoPlayer app (formerly known as **DangoPlayer Uni**). <a href="https://brunochanrio.github.io/DangoPlayer/2025/videotime-migration-removal/">See here why are completely removing the  DangoPlayer Uni migration code from the next version of DangoPlayer --></a>
